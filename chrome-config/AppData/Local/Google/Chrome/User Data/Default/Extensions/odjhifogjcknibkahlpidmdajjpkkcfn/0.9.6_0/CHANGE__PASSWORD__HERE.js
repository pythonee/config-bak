Choose a password for NotScripts with the following restrictions:

Length: 20 minimum, 100 maximum
Allowed Characters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_1234567890

Put your password in between the quotes of the line below that contains the word "ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD".

Save the file and close it when finished. Then, restart Google Chrome.
You will see an error message in NotScripts if there is something wrong with the password.
Also, make a backup copy of this file because when NotScripts updates, Google Chrome will overwrite this file.
If you change to a different password, make sure that you clear your browser HTML5 storage by clearing the cookies.
